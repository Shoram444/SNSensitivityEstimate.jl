# This folder contains 3 examples for how to work with the `SNSensitivityEstimate.jl` package

## The prerequisites to using this package are:
- Have julia installed (versions 1.10+ should be fine) or use `module load julia` if working on `CC` 
- To install the required dependencies:
  - `cd PATH/TO/EXAMPLES/` (must be in the path where `Project.toml` and `Manifest.toml` files are located)
  - Open julia REPL by typing `julia` in bash
  - When in REPL type `import Pkg; Pkg.activate("."); Pkg.instantiate()` which will activate the local environment and automatically load the required dependencies 
  - That's it
